# mac-as-code

Mac-As-Code (MAC) is a script that can save your ass when things turn out differently than they should.

I will give you a small example from my life: 

>One day before a very important presentation I was forced to reinstall my mac due to an error. Of course I have a mac backup but it was not possible to restore from it.

So I decided to write a script which installs all important programs etc for me so that when all else fails I can rely on it and the script does the rest. 

Feel free to use the script and build your own automation-scripts for your macs based on it.
